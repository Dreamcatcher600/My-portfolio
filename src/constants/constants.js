    description: "With Maisonave, security was key since he is a tax agent with many sensitive information. I build his website from scratch. I implemented a client login flow that allows his clients to view their tax paperwork, and make payments to Maisonave for the work done. There is also an Admin profile so that when Eric Maisonave logs in, he can manage all his users and upload their tax information to their profile. I also implemented a way of setting appointment slots according to the business work schedule as well as allowing clients who are logged in to book appointments online.",
